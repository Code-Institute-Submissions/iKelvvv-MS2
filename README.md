# 1. UX

[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)
Everybody knows the basic Rock, Paper, Scissors game, but not everyone knows about the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Liard, Spock game which originated from the TV show, Big Bang Theory. This game adds 2 extra weapons, Lizard and Spock. This changes the who dynamic of the game giving the player/s more variety to win.

I want the player to be engaged with the game.

### User Goals:

*   As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily understand the rules of the game.
*   As a first time visitor, I want to play the game to win.

-   Returning Visitor Goals

*   As a Returning Visitor, I want to beat the computer.
*   As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organization with any questions I may have.

-   Frequent User Goals

*   As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly animations to the weapons.

### User Expectations:

The game should be engaging and clearly display a winner and loser.

-   The weapon selection is clear and obvious.
-   The user interface is easy to navigate.
-   The game is responsive on all devices including mobile, tablet and desktop.

## 1.2. Structure

[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

It is really important to include responsive design in this project as many users are using different devices (mobile, tablet, laptop/PC). This gives the user the best experience on their device.

-   Responsive on all device sizes
-   Easy navigation through labelled buttons
-   Footer at the bottom of the index page that links to the social media website.
-   All elements will be consistent including font size, font family, colour scheme.

## 1.3. Skeleton

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create my wireframes as this gives the template of the UI. This also shows where all elements will be placed within the screen.

There are 2 versions of each wireframe as one shows the design on a web browser and the other shows a mobile browser format.

[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

### All Pages

-   Title and logo is placed at the top of the page.
-   Animated background - to give more of a user experience instead of a plain background.

### Landing Page

-   Introduction button - This button opens up a popup modal. In this modal it gives a introduction of where the game was initially created. There is also an embedded video of the scene at which the game was created.

-   Rules button - This button opens up a popup modal. In this modal it explains all the rules for the game. Listing the winning possibilities of each weapon. There is also a diagram to show the winning outcomes.

-   Contact button - This button opens up a popup modal. In this modal the user can fill out a contact form to contact the owner of the website/game.

-   Footer - The footer is placed at the bottom of this page. This contains all social media links that opens up in a new tab. When hovering over each icon, the icon magnifies.

### Game Page

-   Results - The results section of the page shows the user the outcome of the round.

-   Scoreboard - The scoreboard shows the current score between user and computer. When the player/CPU wins the player or CPU badge will turn green, this indicates that the player/CPU has won the round. When the player/CPU loses the player or CPU badge will turn red, this indicates that the player/CPU has lost the round. The badges will turn yellow if the round is a tie.

-   Select your weapon - This section allows the player to select their desired weapon. There are 5 icons rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock. When hovering over each weapon the icon background changes colour to give the user confirmation before selecting the weapon. The icon colours are also in the order of the Olympic rings.

-   Player/Computer choices - This section shows the selection of weapon made by the player and the generated weapon selection for the computer. This uses the same icons as the initial weapon selection part.

-   Main menu button - This button will take the user back to the index page.

-   Winning GIF - If the user has won 3 rounds, the game ends with a winner's GIF. At this point, this removes all the weapon icons and results and left with a new game button, scoreboard and main menu button. This forces the user to restart the game.

-   Losing GIF - If the computer beaten the user to 3 rounds, the game ends with a loser's GIF. At this point, this removes all the weapon icons and results and left with a new game button, scoreboard and main menu button. This forces the user to restart the game.

# 8. Known Bugs

[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

-   The close "x" button on the popup modals for the index page is not centered. This was rectified by adding padding to the top of the close button.
-   The player/CPU labels on the scoreboard for the game page is not vertically aligned. This was rectified by add padding to the bottom.
-   The placeholder text for the contact form popup modal to close to the left and top side, making the character of the input text hard to read. The was rectified by adding padding to the left side and padding to the top for the message input.
