# 1. UX

[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)
Everybody knows the basic Rock, Paper, Scissors game, but not everyone knows about the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Liard, Spock game which originated from the TV show, Big Bang Theory. This game adds 2 extra weapons, Lizard and Spock. This changes the who dynamic of the game giving the player/s more variety to win.

*   As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organization with any questions I may have.

-   Frequent User Goals

*   As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly animations to the weapons.

### User Expectations:

The game should be engaging and clearly display a winner and loser.

## Scope

As I am unable to include all of the features from the strategy table. I will phase this project in multiple phases. Phase 1 will be what I have identified as a minimum viable product. Please find below the plans I have for each phase.

### Phase 1

-   Engaging game play
-   Score tracking system
-   The ability to play against the computer
-   Responsive design
-   Contact me form
-   Rules popup modal
-   Introduction popup modal

### Phase 2

-   Caption for the winning weapon
-   Dark mode

## 1.2. Structure

[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

It is really important to include responsive design in this project as many users are using different devices (mobile, tablet, laptop/PC). This gives the user the best experience on their device.

-   Responsive on all device sizes
-   Easy navigation through labelled buttons
-   Footer at the bottom of the index page that links to the social media website.
-   All elements will be consistent including font size, font family, colour scheme.

## 1.3. Skeleton

[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create my wireframes as this gives the template of the UI. This also shows where all elements will be placed within the screen.

There are 2 versions of each wireframe as one shows the design on a web browser and the other shows a mobile browser format.
